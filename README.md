# Archive - Canvas Quick Review

This is an **_Archive from the Early Days_**, trivially experimenting with
transform and animation using EaselJs.

It included fooling about with:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JAVASCRIPT
4. JQUERY
5. CANVAS
6. EASELJS

The demo can be viewed on [Code Pen](http://codepen.io/vamtiger/full/aNGYaR/).
